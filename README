# Dodecaphonist
Dodecaphonist is an application with which you can generate random [twelve-tone (dodecaphony)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique) music. 
I wrote it in Python and used PySide 6 to make its user interface.

# Requirements
You need to have [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org) installed to use this program.
It's still a work in progress, so please let me know if you find any bugs.

# Running the program
Clone the repository to your local computer and run main.py. A window should open, showing the available options to customise your twelve-tone piece.
